    "> Linear regression is a supervised machine-learning algorithm.\n",
    "> ...\n",
    "> Supervised machine-learning algorithms learn from the labeled datasets and map the data points to the most optimized linear functions.\n",
    "> ...\n",
    "> Regression predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent input variable.\n",
    "> Example: the prediction of house prices based on different parameters like house age, distance from the main road, location, area, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "> A linear model makes a prediction by simply computing a weighted sum of the input features, plus a constant called the bias term (also called the intercept term), as shown in Equation 4-1.\n",

    "Example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "life_satisfaction = θ0 + θ1 × GDP_per_capita\n",
    "This model is just a linear function of the input feature GDP_per_capita. θ0 and θ1 are the model’s parameters.\n",

    "> What Is Cost Function of Linear Regression?\n",
    "> Cost function measures the performance of a machine learning model for a data set.\n",
    "> Cost function quantifies the error between predicted and expected values and presents that error in the form of a single real number.\n",
