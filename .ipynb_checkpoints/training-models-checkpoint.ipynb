    "> Supervised machine-learning algorithms learn from the labeled datasets and map the data points to the most optimized linear functions.\n",
    "> ...\n",
    "> Regression predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent input variable.\n",
    "> Example: the prediction of house prices based on different parameters like house age, distance from the main road, location, area, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-linear-regression/\n",
    "\n",
    "> A linear model makes a prediction by simply computing a weighted sum of the input features, plus a constant called the bias term (also called the intercept term), as shown in Equation 4-1.\n",
