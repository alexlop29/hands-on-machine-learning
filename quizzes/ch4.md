Here’s the evaluation of your answers based on the topics from Chapter 4 - Training Models:

Correct! The objective of Linear Regression is to minimize the squared differences between observed and predicted values.
Correct! The cost function for Linear Regression indeed measures the squared distance between predicted and actual values for all observations.
Correct! Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm designed to minimize a cost function.
Correct! The learning rate determines the size of the steps Gradient Descent takes toward the cost function's minimum.
Correct! When the degree of the polynomial is too high, the model overfits the training data, capturing noise as patterns.
Incorrect. The correct answer is B. Learning curves plot the model’s performance on training and validation data as a function of the training set size. They’re not specifically for determining the optimal learning rate.
Incorrect. The correct answer is A. Ridge Regression penalizes large weights to reduce overfitting. Assigning zero weights to irrelevant features is a property of Lasso Regression, not Ridge.
Correct! Ridge uses L2 regularization, while Lasso uses L1 regularization, which is a key difference.
Incorrect. The correct answer is B (Underfitting). A large training error combined with a small validation error typically indicates underfitting and high bias.
Correct! Elastic Net Regression is indeed a combination of Ridge and Lasso regression, balancing the benefits of both.
Final Score: 7/10
